            I'm feeling pretty good today because I went online and figures out how to make a menu bar for my website. I think it is turning out pretty well and I am very exicted to see how far I can go with it.

        <p>Today I was fasting for Yom kippur and somehow got bored of TV. I decided to start coding and I ended up coding for around 3 hours. I got really frustrated when trying to push my website, but I was super proud of being able to style my website! I added a journal (clearly) and I also cleaned up my menu bar.</p>

            Today I figured out how to add more toppings and make them change when you click on it. That doesnt really make sense, but i'm so happy it worked! Basically I had to make a new variable called image and when you cilck on the "menu bar" of toppings it changes the variable.ðŸ˜ƒ

            I finally was able to change the angles everytime a topping was added. I made a variable that is set to a random number from 1-360. Then the topping had a transform that rotated it that random number of degrees! It makes it look a lot more realistic.

            today we were asked to make a code that prints the numbers 1-100 where the multiples of three printed "fizz", the multiples of 5 print "buzz" and the mulitples of 15 print "fizzbuzz." I did it in scratch and here is my code!
