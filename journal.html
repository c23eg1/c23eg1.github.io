            I'm feeling pretty good today because I went online and figures out how to make a menu bar for my website. I think it is turning out pretty well and I am very exicted to see how far I can go with it.

        <p>Today I was fasting for Yom kippur and somehow got bored of TV. I decided to start coding and I ended up coding for around 3 hours. I got really frustrated when trying to push my website, but I was super proud of being able to style my website! I added a journal (clearly) and I also cleaned up my menu bar.</p>

            Today I figured out how to add more toppings and make them change when you click on it. That doesnt really make sense, but i'm so happy it worked! Basically I had to make a new variable called image and when you cilck on the "menu bar" of toppings it changes the variable.ðŸ˜ƒ

            I finally was able to change the angles everytime a topping was added. I made a variable that is set to a random number from 1-360. Then the topping had a transform that rotated it that random number of degrees! It makes it look a lot more realistic.

            today we were asked to make a code that prints the numbers 1-100 where the multiples of three printed "fizz", the multiples of 5 print "buzz" and the mulitples of 15 print "fizzbuzz." I did it in scratch and here is my code!

            Today I made a function! Basically, it changes color everytime you click on a square. It is very basic but it will be a great starting point to make many more functions. I had some frustrations with getting it to work, but I used recources on google, like w3, and I was able to figure it out!

            Today our homeowork was to read Javascript for cats. I learned so much while reading this short website. I learned that you can do basically anything from the console. I also leaned about how the replace function works and tried it out in the console! 
            I also worked on my function project for a little longer and actually made the color switch from changing randomely to change based on where you click inside of the box.

            Today I made an <a href="array.html">array</a> that has a bunch of different emojis on it! It was really sool to figure out a new way of making and using functions.

            I have been brainstorming a couple of ideas for a gift. Here are my top 5 ideas.

             They are pretty messy but that is just a rough sketch. I'm pretty interested in the idea about the text messages becaue I think that could be really cute. I also like the trump countdown and dog motivator because those are a little funnier

           Because of winter break i haven't coded in a while, but recently I made a code that randomly places 100 circles that are random colors. The random colors come from an array. And for the random placement I used the math random feature. There is also a clear button that when pressed, all  of the cirlces dissapear. In the future I want to make the circles randomly move around every second and not have to refresh for them to move.

           Today in class Elizabeth helped me figure out hwo to make the dots move every second. We had some issues becasue it stopped working entirely. It took a lot of debugging but we finally figured out that we had placed the function inside of the event listener. It was super satisfying when we got it though!

           Today I started working on my valentine. I decided to incorperate what I did with the swarm project and make it cute. I was making it for my friend hannah who really likes sweethearts with the messages so i decided to make my own sweethearts moving around the page with my own messages. They each have cute inside jokes or sayings. When you click on the page, they all stop moving so you can read them.
